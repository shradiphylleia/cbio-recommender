GSoC 2025 
patient recommendation system

This is a mini demo for the proposed GSoC 2025 project: a patient recommendation system that suggests genomically and clinically similar patients within cBioPortal.
As mentioned: in oncology,comparing similar cases can inform research and treatment strategies.This tool aims to automate that process using molecular and clinical profiles.

# what will you find here:
1. FastAPI backend demo
2. Basic API to return mock "similar patients"
3. Placeholder similarity logic(to be replaced with real data+models)

# usingðŸ§±
python, fastapi
cbio_py for data
